# Bellman Ford Algorithm Implementation

First Enter the number of vertices in the graph

Then enter the graph as an adjacency matrix of the weights on each edge

If there is no edge between two vertices, enter 0 as its weight

Negative cycles are detected in the algorithm 

After that enter the serial number of the vertex around which you need to get the shortest distances

After pressing enter, you get the desired output

You also get the amount of time it took to get the answer i.e., time to execute the algorithm
